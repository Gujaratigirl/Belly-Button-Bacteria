# D3_Plots

## Set up plots to view all samples in the dataset via the drop down menu. 

Belly Button Bacteria!   

Eww, Yet interesting.  

This data will help you see how many bacteria COULD be in your belly button and how it is affected by cleaning.

ENJOY!!   

Interesting homework allowing the use of our newly learned skills.   

Was able to create dropdown menu, demographics section, the bar plot , gauge chart and bubble chart.  
Initiated the tables at the beginning of the code and then use 'restyle' to update just the necessary aspects.
